# Thinkful Front-End Web Development

In May 2014, I participated in the Front-end Web Development course from [Thinkful](http://www.thinkful.com). In this course you 

- Build eight sleek and interactive websites with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and Git. 
- Learn web development and apply UX design principles to create user-friendly products.

The 8 websites were:

1. HTML Resume - a basic resume page focusing on the HTML structure.
2. Google Clone - the google search page, focusing on using CSS to reproduce a given design. 
3. Small Business Landing Page - I created a landing page for the TestStack open source organisation.
4. Shopping List - an app to add and remove items from a shopping list, focusing on interactivity with jQuery.
5. Hot or Cold - a game where the user has to guess a number and is told if they are 'hot' or 'cold.' Focuses on JavaScript functions.
6. Quiz - create a quiz game that leads the user through a series of questions, focusing on JavaScript data with JSON and arrays.
7. API Hack - build an app that utilises JSON APIs. I built a Currency Converter that pulled currencies and live exchange rates from https://openexchangerates.org/.
8. Portfolio - a website to display all of the Thinkful projects.

In additon the following projects were also created:

- Street Fighter - using jQuery to create animations for the Street Fighter game.
- FizzBuzz - use JavaScript to create the Fizz Buzz game.
- Stack Overflow Reputation Builder. Focuses on building an app using external JSON APIs, such as the one from Stack Overflow.
